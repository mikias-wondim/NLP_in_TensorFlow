**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to understand and generate human language. NLP is used in a wide range of applications, including:

* Text Classification
* Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another.
* Text summarization: Creating concise summaries of longer texts.
* Sentiment analysis: Determining the sentiment of a text (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).
* Named entity recognition: Identifying named entities in a text (e.g., people, places, organizations).
* Question answering: Answering questions based on a text or a set of texts.


NLP is a complex and challenging field, but it is also a rapidly growing one. As the amount of text data available 


## NLP Text Classification

In this tutorial, we will cover:

**Text Classification NLP using Kaggle's Disaster Tweets Dataset**

**Objective**:

We will use NLP techniques to classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not. We will use the NLP with Disaster Tweets dataset from Kaggle.

**Dataset**:

The NLP with Disaster Tweets dataset contains over 10,000 tweets labeled as either related to a disaster or not. The dataset is divided into training and test sets.
